# 🔥 The ASX Paradigm - Complete Vision

**ASX is not a framework. ASX is the replacement.**

This repository demonstrates how ASX completely replaces React/Vite and establishes a new paradigm for web development.

## Core Principles

### 1. Tapes Are Fractal Systems
Every tape is self-contained and can:
- Run standalone
- Be loaded by another tape
- Load other tapes
- Broadcast a REST API

### 2. GHOST Enables Communication
The Global Host Orchestration Specification for Tapes (GHOST) defines:
- How tapes register
- How tapes communicate
- How agents route
- How external services integrate

### 3. HOLO UI Is Universal
All tapes share the green phosphor CRT aesthetic:
- Consistent visual language
- Scanlines and glow effects
- Monospace typography
- Card-based layouts

## The Revolution

**Before:** React app with node_modules, build tools, framework churn

**After:** Pure HTML/JS/CSS tapes that run anywhere, forever

See the complete documentation:
- `ASX-REPLACES-FRAMEWORKS.md` - Why ASX replaces React/Vite
- `GHOST-SPECIFICATION.md` - Universal host protocol
- `HOLO-UI-STANDARD.html` - Visual design system
- `studio/README.md` - Development environment

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/cannaseedus-bot/asx-tapes-arcade

# Run (no build needed!)
open arcade/index.html
```

**That's it. No npm install. No build step. Pure ASX.**
